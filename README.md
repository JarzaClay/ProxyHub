# ProxyHub
A hub for a bunch of Ludicrous unblockers deployed by JarzaClay

<b><strong>
Use ProxyHub at your own risk. I am not responsible if you get caught using ProxyHub, but I will make help you as much as I can to not get caught.

# Why did I make ProxyHub?
I used to go to public school, and the opression that they put on students with their block filter is ridiculous. I have been gifted with the ability to code, and I hope that I can help everyone I can to evade these ridiculous blocks.

# Who am I?
I am a normal person like you! I just want to do things in school that are actually fun!

# Will I update ProxyHub?
I will update ProxyHub regularly, but if you need help with something, let me know under issues!

Love you all! â™¥ -JarzaClay
